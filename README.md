# Quizzler: The Future of Personalized Learning

Quizzler is an AI-powered mobile learning app designed to deliver highly personalized, engaging, and effective learning experiences. Developed as a research-backed project at Thakur College of Engineering & Technology, Mumbai, Quizzler leverages advanced machine learning to overcome the limitations of traditional education.

## 1. Features

- **Adaptive Assessments**  
  Dynamically adjust quizzes and assignments based on user performance, identifying strengths and targeting weaknesses.

- **Personalized Learning Paths**  
  Recommendations of resources and exercises are tailored to individual learning styles and progress.

- **Focus Mode**  
  Creates a distraction-free study environment, reducing interruptions and enabling deep concentration.

- **Exam Mode**  
  Provides a secure testing environment with features such as single-window enforcement and anti-cheating measures.

- **AI-driven Insights**  
  Smart feedback and analytics to guide learners and educators for optimized outcomes.

## 2. How Quizzler Works

Quizzler uses a hybrid machine learning architecture:
1. **Decision Tree:** Predicts future performance using historical quiz and activity data.
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Classifies users into learning styles (Visual, Auditory, Kinaesthetic, Read/Write).
3. **Bayesian Network:** Models the probability of outcomes based on student characteristics and activity.
4. **Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM):** Analyzes sequential learning data for deeper trend prediction.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors:** Recommends strategies and resources that worked for similar learners.

These models work together to personalize every aspect of the learning journey.

## 3. Research & Validation

- 15% increase in average test scores for students using Quizzler versus traditional methods.
- Reports of higher engagement, motivation, and personal ownership from users.
- Mixed-methods evaluation: Quantitative academic improvement and qualitative learner satisfaction.
